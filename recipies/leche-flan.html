    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar (for caramel)</li>
        <li>10 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Caramel:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar until it turns into a light 
                    brown caramel. Swirl the pan occasionally to ensure even melting.</li>
                <li>Once the caramel is ready, pour it into a llanera (flan mold) or a round baking pan, 
                    tilting the mold to coat the bottom evenly. Set aside to cool and harden.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Custard:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter until well combined.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks gently until well blended.</li>
                <li>Add the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. 
                Mix until smooth and well combined, avoiding creating too many bubbles.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Strain the Mixture:</strong>For a smoother texture, strain the custard mixture through a fine sieve into another bowl to remove any lumps or bubbles.</li>

        <li><strong>Pour into mold:</strong>Pour the strained custard mixture into the prepared mold with the caramel.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam or Bake:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steaming Method:</strong>Cover the mold with aluminum foil. Steam over medium heat for about 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li><strong>Baking Method:</strong>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the mold in a larger baking dish filled with hot water (water bath). Cover the mold with aluminum foil and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the custard is set.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Cool and Unmold</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the leche flan to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
                <li>To unmold, run a knife around the edges of the flan to loosen it. Place a serving plate on top of the mold and carefully invert it to release the flan.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Slice and serve this delectable leche flan, enjoying its creamy texture and rich caramel flavor.</li>
